<b>Quick hummus recipe</b><br>
<p>
    <em>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes
        that
        I
        have read over the years.
        Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad,
        grilled
        meats and pitta breads.</em>

        </ins>
        :
        <ol type="a">
            <li>can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
    <li>175g of tahini</li>
    <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
    <li>Half a red pepper</li>
    <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
    <li>A dash of olive oil</li> </ol>
</ul>

<em><strong>Instructions</strong></em><br>
<ol>
    <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
    <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
    <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
    <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li>
    <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
    <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>
    For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and
    chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.<br>
</p>
<p>
    <b>Storage</b><br>
</p>
<p>
    Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've
    made
    it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.<br>

    Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.<br>
